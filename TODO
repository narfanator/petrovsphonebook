Instead of passwords - noncewords!
Basically, take the Auth0 ID for the person, combine it with their nonce word, and hash it.
That's then their user ID.
Advise people to use something memorable and uncommon, but it doesn't have to be crazy, since it's not actually
a password - their AuthO results handle that part.
